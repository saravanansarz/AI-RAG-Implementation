To set up Azure OpenAI for your project:

1. Create an Azure account and sign in to the Azure Portal.
2. Search for “Azure OpenAI” in the portal and create a new Azure OpenAI resource.
3. Once deployed, go to the resource and create a deployment (choose a model like gpt-35-turbo or gpt-4).
4. In the Azure OpenAI resource, go to “Keys and Endpoint” to get your API key and endpoint URL.
5. Set these as environment variables in your system or in a .env file:

AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT (the deployment name you created)

$env:AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key-here"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT="https://your-resource-name.openai.azure.com/"
$env:AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT="your-deployment-name"
